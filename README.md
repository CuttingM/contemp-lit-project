# Contemporary Literature Project
This small projected is intended to foster "book love" by allowing potential readers to discover new books through a visual means. Here, I create web pages for books I have recently read, and people can then access these pages by scanning QR codes. Each web page offers a visually appealing layout that creates interest in the book.
