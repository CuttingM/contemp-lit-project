                    Sunlight glared down on Coriolanus as he scrambled to untangle
                    his body from the pack.
                    He staggered out a few yards, righted himself, and froze in horror....
                    Between the sets of bars, the faces of Capitol children gawked at him.
                    He was in the monkey house at the zoo.

                    Coriolanus stared down into the mass of wriggling snakes,
                    with their flicking tongues.
                    Sure enough, he could catch phrases of his proposal between the coils.

                    Coriolanus knew bombs, and they terrified him.
                    Even as the impact threw him off his feet and tossed him farther into the arena,
                    his arms lifted to cover his head....
                    The first explosion, which seemed to have come from the main gate,
                    initiated a chain of eruptions around the arena.

                    Coriolanus felt sure he'd spotted his first mockingjay,
                    and he disliked the thing on sight....
                    Perhaps, if he ever did become an officer, he could organize
                    a hunting party to clear the woods of them.
                    But why wait?
                    Why not suggest it now, for the recruits, as a form of target practice?
