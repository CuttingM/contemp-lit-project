                Coriolanus stared down into the mass of wriggling snakes,
                with their flicking tongues.
                Sure enough, he could catch phrases of his proposal between the coils.

                Coriolanus knew bombs, and they terrified him.
                Even as the impact threw him off his feet and tossed him farther into the arena,
                his arms lifted to cover his head....
                The first explosion, which seemed to have come from the main gate,
                initiated a chain of eruptions around the arena.
